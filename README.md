The design was given so I coudn't do much about it.

The main focus of this assignment were :

- The accessibility of the whole site.

- The use of some factory patterns.

- The implementation of a modale.

- The implementation of a form and its validation.

- The extraction and the sanitization of some datas given as a json file.
